md4 is the subpool of patientes that had been discharged between 19950101 to 20000101
By identifying the patients that have at least one HF diseases, we remove these patients
(n = 246163) from the population and get md5 (n=15613903)

md7 is all the observations that 
is older than 18 years old on the year of 2000
included at least one HF in their primary diagnosis,
discharged between 20000101 to 20140101 
no previous HF conditions, and sorted by patient_ID & admission_date

md7u (n=200423) is the first observation for each patients' record in md7 (n=374252)

We can draw some basic stat using the md7u now.
